\&lt;Intro 1-2p\&gt; **Alex**

- Recycle previous
- Motivate
- Overview user-level, functional/performance, environmental reqs
  - 2nd half should be condensed reqs doc

\&lt;Implementation Overview 1p\&gt; **Austin**

- Big picture technologies
- Solution vision
- Overall approach
  - Frameworks/techniques and what they contribute

\&lt;Architectural  Overview 2p\&gt; **Austin/Chance (part 1, part 2)**

- Part 1:
  - Architectural diagram of system&#39;s high-level architecture
    - ■■Most important components
- Part 2:
  - Discussion of architecture
    - ■■Key responsibilities/features of each component
    - ■■Main communication mechanisms/information control flows
    - ■■Influences of 1+ architectural styles embodied by this architecture

\&lt;Module and Interface Descriptions 6-8p\&gt; **Chance/Turan discuss which modules to split up and do, or split up by task inside modules (one does descriptions other does UML)**

For each module:

- English description of component and how it fits into the architecture
- UML diagram of classes involved in component (or appropriate sub-program diagram)
- Description of the public interface
  - &quot;Explicitly outlines the services that the component provides&quot;
  - Forr OOP this means public methods and their types/parameters

\&lt;Implementation Plan 1-2p\&gt; **Turan**

- Design-centric implementation timeline
- Gantt chart
  - Each module and associated testing and integration
- Narrate major Gantt chart points/phases
  - Mention anything not graphically visible
- Roughly divide tasks to members
  - Either in Gantt chart, in a simple table, or in the narrative

\&lt;conclusion ½-1\&gt; **Alex**

- Big picture value
- Summarize document
- How it contributes positively to project outcome
